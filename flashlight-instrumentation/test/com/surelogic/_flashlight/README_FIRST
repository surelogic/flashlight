** WARNING **

The JUnit tests in this directory cannot all be run together.  Please
run one after the other so that each test is within its own JVM.  This is
required because Flashlight's Store uses static data that causes
interference between the tests if they are run all together within the same
JVM.

Some of the tests dump a file into java.io.tmpdir that you'll need to clean up.

Further, some of these tests depend upon the System.gc() and could
fail when there is really nothing wrong with the code.  Delays have been
built into the test to minimize the probability of this type of failure
occurring.
